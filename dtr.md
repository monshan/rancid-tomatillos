# DTR

**Project:** Rancid Tomatillos

**Primary Contributors:** Marika Shanahan & Connor Anderson-Larson

**Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project?)** 

> How React do the thing: 
* And how to do the thing with React
* Connor: Do more CSS stuff (playing nice with React) and potentially Sassy CSS, keep experimenting, continuing to work with API calls
* Marika: Immature understanding of React => working ability with creating a fully functioning React App, agree that ansynchronous JS is a learning curve andf being able to speak to it (with terms of art)

**What do we want to achieve as a team?**

> Beyond the goals and expectations of the learning aspect of this project:
*  We spoke mainly to subjective learning goals in the goals and expectations portion above
* Functional goals stand at Iteration 3 of the project spec dealing with network requests and async

**How will we know that we're successful?**

> A clean, stylistic web app that displays professionalism both user-side and developer-side. That is mutually agreed to be a substantial work.

**Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here)** 

Marika: Flexible working independently or synchronously, open to looking towards outside resources (network or documentation)
Connor: User and developer empathy in mind, flexibility, usually turns to independent/internal search efforts to get over blocks
Team style: Overall very flexible and likely will meet project needs as efficiently as possible considering time and efforts, all-around empathy will always be a priority, can build on each others diverse styles of overcoming blocks.

**How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles**

> Through the power of friendship:
* Hark! They do be on yonder
* But for realisies just be nice 

**Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?)**

### Synchronus Meetings
It is the expectation that both members will meet synchronusly during all calendar designated work time until the project due date for stand-up. Because work time usually falls in the afternoon we will commit to staying on zoom from whenever the session begins until dinner (approximately **5PM MST**)
Any other synchronus meetings will be mutually determined on demand of the project to best meet our workflow timeline.

### Asynchronus Work Time
Be active on slack outside determined meetings with the expectation of responding within the work day unless sent after **5PM MST** which would default to the next day

**Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate?** 

### Work Reporting
Send a (short, no limit) slack message to the Team by 11:59 PM MST covering any major changes of said work day, blocks, potential ways forward and goals for the next day

**How do we keep lines of communication open?** 

> Slack and zoom 

**How will we make decisions as a team?**

> Well, because Connor is a crybaby sub, Marika will make the final call on everything. BAM!

**How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?**

> Safe words are...
* _Notice me senpai_
* _ichi nii san nya_
* _when you act like a baka_

Send the following at the end of work report and before checkins
1. 💚 Good: Egirls are ruining my life
2. 🌝 Okay: Catgirls are ruining my life
3. 🛑 Bad: Daywalker ft. Corpse Husbando

**Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement)**

**Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?)**

> Overall, keep as close levels of contribution as possible (like true nakama)

**Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques)**

* Follow the gitFlow guildlines as defined by Turing.

**Pomodoro Break Schedule**
