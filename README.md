## Abstract

Rancid Tomatillos utilizes new-to-us technologies including React, React/Router, and Cypress to create a React app that displays movies, and movie information. Focus was placed on learning and implementing systems; some details include:


* Create a multi-page emulating site using React Router
* Test user happy/sad paths as well as API errors
Along with introducing new technology this was a great experience working in a pair asynchronously, balancing solo work with reliable meetings and excellent daily standups.

* React Router
* Cypress Testing Framework
* JavaScript ES6
* CSS3
* HTML5
* Normalize
* Wave
* Lighthouse
* Git
* Text Editors of Choice:
  * Atom
  * VSCode

## Initial Setup:

* Clone this repo down, once inside use `npm start` to start the local host.
* Site should open in web browser of choice.
* If site does not open, going to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) after starting local host will bring you to site.
