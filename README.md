## Abstract

Rancid Tomatillos utilizes new-to-us technologies including React, React/Router, and Cypress to create a React app that displays movies, and movie information. Focus was placed on learning and implementing systems; some details include:
* Create a multi-page emulating site using React components

* JavaScript
* CSS
* HTML
* Normalize
* Wave
* Lighthouse
* Git
* Atom/vsCode

## Initial Setup:
